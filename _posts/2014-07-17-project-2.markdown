description: This project aimed to design a simulation of a recycling sorting plant that transports up to a maximum of 3 sorted containers at a time. In charge of the programming aspect of the simulation, I used Python to develop five functions for the Quanser robot (Q-bot) to sort the containers effectively in a virtual simulation. Afterwards, the program was tested in a physical environment with an actual Q-bot, which succeeded in transporting a few actual containers given a specific distance.
