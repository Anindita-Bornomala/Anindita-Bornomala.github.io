description: As the year-end final project, my team was tasked with designing a solution to improve the daily lives of visually impaired clients. We wanted to design a device that would simplify their process of identifying spices while cooking, so we created the “Auditory Spice Rack”, a spice shelf that delivers an audio cue of the name of the spice container that is taken out. Our final design was a prototype consisting of one shelf space, a mini-speaker, and a Raspberry Pi to determine the specific spice being taken.
